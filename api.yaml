        Returns all historical transactions for the specified user and filtering criteria. It's recommended to use `startDate` and `endDate` to paginate through the data, as the response may be very large for accounts with a long history and/or a lot of activity. There's a max number of 10000 transactions returned per request.

        There is no guarantee to the ordering of the transactions returned. Please sort the transactions based on the `trade_date` field if you need them in a specific order.

        The data returned here is always cached and refreshed once a day.

            Whether the connection is disabled. A disabled connection can no longer access the latest data from the brokerage, but will continue to return the last cached state. A connection can become disabled for many reasons and differs by brokerage. Here are some common scenarios:

            - The user has changed their username or password at the brokerage.
            - The user has explicitly removed the access grant at the brokerage.
            - The session has expired at the brokerage and now requires explicit user re-authentication.

      description: >
        This response consists of 2 different components that must be
        decrypted to obtain the decrypted message


        * Decrypting the encryptedSharedKey

          The encrypted shared key is a shared key that was randomly generated by SnapTrade and encrypted using the users SSH public key provided when registering the user
          It is needed to decrypt the message in step 2.

          To decrypt the shared key, the user should have access to their SSH private key stored locally in their device

          An example Python code on how to decrypt the shared key is shown below

          ```
          def decrypt_rsa_message(self, encrypted_message):
              from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
              from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
              from base64 import b64decode

              f = open('private.pem', 'r')
              private_key = RSA.import_key(f.read())
              cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key)

              return cipher.decrypt(b64decode(encrypted_message.encode())).decode()
          ```

        * Decrypting the encryptedMessageData

           The data meant to be returned by an endpoint can be obtained by decrypting the encrypted message

           An encrypted message is a message that is encrypted using AES - MODE OCB with the shared key obtained in step one

          An example code to decrypt the encrypted message is shown below

          ```
          def decrypt_aes_message(self, shared_key, encrypted_message):
              from Crypto.Cipher import AES
              from base64 import b64decode

              encrypted_msg = b64decode(encrypted_message["encryptedMessage"].encode())
              tag = b64decode(encrypted_message["tag"].encode())
              nonce = b64decode(encrypted_message["nonce"].encode())
              cipher = AES.new(shared_key.encode(), AES.MODE_OCB, nonce=nonce)

              return cipher.decrypt_and_verify(encrypted_msg, tag).decode()
          ```
