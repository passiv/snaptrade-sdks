/**
 * Status of account transaction sync. SnapTrade syncs transactions from the brokerage under the following conditions: 1. Initial connection - SnapTrade syncs all transactions from the brokerage account as far back as the brokerage allows. Check [our integrations doc](https://snaptrade.notion.site/66793431ad0b416489eaabaf248d0afb?v=6fab8012ade6441fa0c6d9af9c55ce3a) for details on how far back we sync for each brokerage. 2. Daily sync - Once a day SnapTrade syncs new transactions from the brokerage. 3. Manual sync - You can retrigger an incremental sync of transactions with the [manual refresh](/reference/Connections/Connections_refreshBrokerageAuthorization) endpoint.
