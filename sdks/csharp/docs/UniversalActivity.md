**Id** | **string** | Unique identifier for the transaction. This is the ID used to reference the transaction in SnapTrade.  Please note that this ID _can_ change if the transaction is deleted and re-added. Under normal circumstances, SnapTrade does not delete transactions. The only time this would happen is if SnapTrade re-fetches and reprocesses the data from the brokerage, which is rare. If you require a stable ID, please let us know and we can work with you to provide one.  | [optional]
