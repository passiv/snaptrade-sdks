        Returns a list of all connections for the specified user. Note that `Connection` and `Brokerage Authorization` are interchangeable, but the term `Connection` is preferred and used in the doc for consistency.

        A connection is usually tied to a single login at a brokerage. A single connection can contain multiple brokerage accounts.

        SnapTrade performs de-duping on connections for a given user. If the user has an existing connection with the brokerage, when connecting the brokerage with the same credentials, SnapTrade will return the existing connection instead of creating a new one.

        Manually force the specified connection to become disabled. This should only be used for testing a reconnect flow, and never used on production connections.
        Will trigger a disconnect as if it happened naturally, and send a [`CONNECTION_BROKEN` webhook](/docs/webhooks#webhooks-connection_broken) for the connection.

        This endpoint is available on test keys. If you would like it enabled on production keys as well, please contact support as it is disabled by default.

        There is no guarantee to the ordering of the transactions returned. Please sort the transactions based on the `trade_date` field if you need them in a specific order.

        Places a brokerage order in the specified account. The order could be rejected by the brokerage if it is invalid or if the account does not have sufficient funds.

        This endpoint does not compute the impact to the account balance from the order and any potential commissions before submitting the order to the brokerage. If that is desired, you can use the [check order impact endpoint](/reference/Trading/Trading_getOrderImpact).

        It's recommended to trigger a manual refresh of the account after placing an order to ensure the account is up to date. You can use the [manual refresh](/reference/Connections/Connections_refreshBrokerageAuthorization) endpoint for this.

            The Time in Force type for the order. This field indicates how long the order will remain active before it is executed or expires. We try our best to map brokerage time in force values to the following. When mapping fails, we will return the brokerage's time in force value.
              - `Day` - Day. The order is valid only for the trading day on which it is placed.
              - `GTC` - Good Til Canceled. The order is valid until it is executed or canceled.
              - `FOK` - Fill Or Kill. The order must be executed in its entirety immediately or be canceled completely.
              - `IOC` - Immediate Or Cancel. The order must be executed immediately. Any portion of the order that cannot be filled immediately will be canceled.
              - `GTD` - Good Til Date. The order is valid until the specified date.
              - `MOO` - Market On Open. The order is to be executed at the day's opening price.
              - `EHP` - Extended Hours P.M. The order is to be placed during extended hour trading, after markets close.

        A single connection with a brokerage. Note that `Connection` and `Brokerage Authorization` are interchangeable, but the term `Connection` is preferred and used in the doc for consistency.

        A connection is usually tied to a single login at a brokerage. A single connection can contain multiple brokerage accounts.

        SnapTrade performs de-duping on connections for a given user. If the user has an existing connection with the brokerage, when connecting the brokerage with the same credentials, SnapTrade will return the existing connection instead of creating a new one.

            - The user has explicitly removed the access grant at the brokerage.
            - The session has expired at the brokerage and now requires explicit user re-authentication.

            Please note that this ID _can_ change if the transaction is deleted and re-added. Under normal circumstances, SnapTrade does not delete transactions. The only time this would happen is if SnapTrade re-fetches and reprocesses the data from the brokerage, which is rare. If you require a stable ID, please let us know and we can work with you to provide one.

      additionalProperties: false
      description: |
        This response consists of 2 different components that must be decrypted to obtain the decrypted message

        * Decrypting the encryptedSharedKey

          The encrypted shared key is a shared key that was randomly generated by SnapTrade and encrypted using the users SSH public key provided when registering the user
          It is needed to decrypt the message in step 2.

          To decrypt the shared key, the user should have access to their SSH private key stored locally in their device

          An example Python code on how to decrypt the shared key is shown below

          ```
          def decrypt_rsa_message(self, encrypted_message):
              from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
              from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
              from base64 import b64decode

              f = open('private.pem', 'r')
              private_key = RSA.import_key(f.read())
              cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key)

              return cipher.decrypt(b64decode(encrypted_message.encode())).decode()
          ```

        * Decrypting the encryptedMessageData

           The data meant to be returned by an endpoint can be obtained by decrypting the encrypted message

           An encrypted message is a message that is encrypted using AES - MODE OCB with the shared key obtained in step one

          An example code to decrypt the encrypted message is shown below

          ```
          def decrypt_aes_message(self, shared_key, encrypted_message):
              from Crypto.Cipher import AES
              from base64 import b64decode

              encrypted_msg = b64decode(encrypted_message["encryptedMessage"].encode())
              tag = b64decode(encrypted_message["tag"].encode())
              nonce = b64decode(encrypted_message["nonce"].encode())
              cipher = AES.new(shared_key.encode(), AES.MODE_OCB, nonce=nonce)

              return cipher.decrypt_and_verify(encrypted_msg, tag).decode()
          ```
