  # unit tests for get_activities
  # Get transaction history for a user
  # This endpoint is being deprecated but will continue to be available for use via SDKs, please use [the account level endpoint](/reference/Account%20Information/AccountInformation_getAccountActivities) if possible  Returns all historical transactions for the specified user and filtering criteria. It&#39;s recommended to use &#x60;startDate&#x60; and &#x60;endDate&#x60; to paginate through the data, as the response may be very large for accounts with a long history and/or a lot of activity. There&#39;s a max number of 10000 transactions returned per request.  There is no guarantee to the ordering of the transactions returned. Please sort the transactions based on the &#x60;trade_date&#x60; field if you need them in a specific order.  The data returned here is always cached and refreshed once a day.
