  # unit tests for get_user_account_recent_orders
  # List account recent orders (last 24 hours only)
  # A lightweight endpoint that returns a list of orders executed in the last 24 hours in the specified account. This endpoint is realtime and can be used to quickly check if account state has recently changed due to an execution, or check status of recently placed orders Differs from /orders in that it is realtime, and only checks the last 24 hours as opposed to the last 30 days By default only returns executed orders, but that can be changed by setting *only_executed* to false **Because of the cost of realtime requests, each call to this endpoint incurs an additional charge. You can find the exact cost for your API key on the [Customer Dashboard billing page](https://dashboard.snaptrade.com/settings/billing)**
