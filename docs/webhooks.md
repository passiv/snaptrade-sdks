# Webhooks

The SnapTrade API can be configured to send you webhook notifications when certain events happen.

To get started with webhooks, visit the webhook tab of the SnapTrade Dashboard to configure a webhook listener.

# Verifying Webhook Authenticity

You can verify the authenticity of any SnapTrade webhook by verifying the `webhookSecret` field contained in the body of any webhook.

The correct value of this secret can be found when you configure a webhook listener in the SnapTrade Dashboard.

Aside from webhook secrets:

- SnapTrade supports custom webhook request headers (which are useful if your webhook handler is protected by Cloudflare)
- SnapTrade does not support IP whitelisting at this time

# Handling Undeliverable Webhooks

When your webhook handler responds to our requests with a status code that is not 200, 201, 202, or 204, we mark that webhook as undelivered in our system.

We will attempt to resend an undeliverable webhook notification with an exponential backoff (starting at 30 minutes) until it is either delivered successfully, or 3 retry attempts have been made.

## TRADES_PLACED

Gets sent when new trades are detected in a user's account.

On average, you'll receive a webhook within 30 minutes of activity occurring in the account (we poll once per hour).

We send 1 webhook regardless of how many new trades are identified in your account. So if we identify 1 trade in the account, we'll send 1 webhook; and if we identify 10 trades in the account, we also only send 1 webhook.

Please contact us in order to receive these webhooks as they are disabled by default.

Example payload is below:
```json
{
  "userId": "vAzgPrUHizYheZVi_WEALTHSIMPLETRADE_oiuzalkd",
  "clientId": "PARTNERAPP",

}
```

## ACCOUNT_HOLDINGS_UPDATED

Gets sent when holdings for an account has been updated. Updated does not necessarily mean that the holdings have changed, instead it means that updating holdings with new data has been attempted. In the rare case that a holdings update fails (for example when a brokerage's API is down for maintenance), the webhook will still be sent and details on what failed will be included as part of the details field in the body.

This webhook will be sent when we run our daily account syncs, as well as if a manual account refresh has been requested via: https://docs.snaptrade.com/reference/Connections/Connections_refreshBrokerageAuthorization

Account Holdings in this context refers to:
 - Positions
 - Balances
 - Orders
 - Total Account Value
 - Account Detail

Historical transactions will be polled for, but will not fetch transactions from the current day

```json
{
  "userId": "60b9ad5f-8e78-43b2-af5a-8ce8412b1cd6",
