# Brokerage Integrations

SnapTrade supports opening connections to 20+ financial institutions around the world. Sometimes a single institution can have multiple integrations depending on geography or account type. For example we support Webull USA and Webull Canada as two distinct integrations. Similarly, Alpaca and Alpaca Paper are two distinct integrations despite belonging to the same company. For in-depth information on each brokerage that we support, please refer to [SnapTrade Brokerage Integrations](https://www.notion.so/SnapTrade-Brokerage-Integrations-f83946a714a84c3caf599f6a945f0ead?pvs=21).
